Plant Data Retrieval 

As this was my first attempt at a Python project I kept the idea behind this very simple
1) Provide the user with a list of plants
2) ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51059555/173700049-77015941-b348-476e-9c4b-4e7f563e2d34.png)
3) Repeat the users input and provide another list with additional options 
4) ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51059555/173700154-7a9bd89f-5a87-480e-974c-a88d2056d00d.png)
5) Again, repeat the users input and return data specific to the user's choice
6) ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51059555/173700255-cba0f096-3b2e-425d-8dca-532a743c373c.png)
7) Utilize error handling and exit the program where appropriate
8) ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51059555/173700324-923ba164-857c-4964-a271-346d822dae2f.png)

This was my first introduction to indexing a user's input to provide a secondary list where the results would be specific to the user's choice. This also included appropriate error handling and exiting the program at appropriate breaks in the code.
